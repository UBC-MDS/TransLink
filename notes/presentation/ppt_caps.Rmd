## Business Question - high costs

> * Insurance premium is one of the largest spendings in TransLink's budget
> * In the past five years, claim costs have increased by about 122.5%
> * Therefore, we have been asked to find:
  - .fragment potential strong predictors of claim severity/frequency that TransLink can leverage to help reduce costs

## Research Questions

- What are the main predictors of the frequency and severity of bus accidents?
       - Driver characteristics (probation period, experience)
       - Claim types and other accident descriptions
       - Bus model/model year
       - Bus routes
       - Acceleration/decceleration
       - Weather
       - Time
       - Geographic location
       - ...
    
- Within specific categorical features (such as claim type codes), are there specific clusters or groupings that are particularly noteworthy for having worse or better claims experience?  

---
## High Level Data Descriptions

- Speed Performance
- Incident Operators (truncation)
- Collisions (Preventable and Non-Preventable)
- Claims

## Data Product

> * A reproducible, **interactive** report that allows the reader to:
    - .fragment visualize relationships between claim frequency/severity and specific variables interactively
    - .fragment potentially query a predictive model, again interactively
  
<sketch of report here?>

> * A fully reproducible data pipeline
    - .fragment user-friendly way to run the entire data analysis front to back using simple Make commands
    - .fragment stored on a Docker container
    - .fragment detailed documentation describing how to run the analysis and the code

## Methodology

- Join the Collision and Incident Operators datasets with respect to the claim ID (if given) and then split the whole dataset into test and train datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis on the resulting training set (visualizations to assess potential predictors of interest such as density plots, boxplots, barcharts, etc.)
- Possibly a rigorous statistical analysis (hypothesis testing) to answer the questions of whether certain variables such as driver experience, bus routes, weather, etc. are significantly correlated with incident rate

---
## Methodology (cont)

- If complete data is provided, a regression (linear regression or a tree based learner possibly) on incident rate/hour worked based off driver characteristics, time of day, etc.
- A Bayesian regression model to address the problem of truncation in the Incident Operators dataset or a Zero-Truncated Poisson (if complete data is not provided)
- Cluster Analysis for analysis of specific categorical features like claim type code, claim description (Markov Chains, LDA, DBSCAN)

## Rough Timeline (May 4th - June 10th)

- Milestone I (May 4th - May 25th, 2020):
  - finalize the datasets that we are working with, along with train/test splits
  - plan to complete all of the analysis described above in the methodology by the end of the month
  - this includes model building and answering the specific hypotheses proposed by TransLink
  
- Milestone II (May 26th - June 10th, 2020):
  - start and finish the interactive report
  - check over the data pipeline with a Make file, create Docker image

## Rough Timeline (June 11th - June 19th)

- Milestone III (June 10th - June 19th, 2020):
  - review report
  - prepare final presentation to TransLink

- Milestone IV (June 20th - June 23rd, 2020):
  - improve interactive report based off feedback from TransLink
  - complete the final report
