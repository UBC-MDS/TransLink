 This is a mentored group project for the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia with the business parther Business Technology Services (BTS) and Insurance Claims groups of TransLink.
 
## Overview

The insurance premium is one of the largest spendings in TransLink's budget. Translink has paid over \$18 million to ICBC and \$1.6 million to the captive insurance company which makes nearly \$20 million in total. These costs are in increasing trend in the last 5 years and one of the biggest factors in this increase is the rise in the number of claims.

To help TransLink reduce their insurance costs we will be looking for answers for the following questions:

* What are the patterns between different conditions of claims?

* What are the factors to avoid the incidences/claims that will eventually result in reducing the cost of insurance and claims?
