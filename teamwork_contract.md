- All informal communication can be done via. Slack
- Any correspondence between the Capstone partner and the group should have Simon CC'd
- All decisions should be made collaboratively (should probably make this more specific). If anyone feels unfair or not comfortable by any group decision, please always say it and let others know. 

# Group meetings
 - Meetings can be held on daily.(Maybe in the morning)
 - Extra meeting hours can be discussed and agreed upon as required
 - 

# Completing tasks
  - Be transparent if you are unable to complete the task assigned
  - Prioritize the basics (get a working viable product, then work on optimization)
  - Voice your ideas/concerns and feedback promptly/frequently
  - Don't stress, this is supposed to be fun!
  - If you get stuck, ask a team mate for help instead of struggling on your own

# Deadlines:
 - We can specify some datelines within our group, then we can review our works.
