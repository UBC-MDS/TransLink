# Expectations Between Group Members and Simon

-

# Communication

- All meetings should be documented by somebody (notes) and uploaded to the [private Github repo](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/TransLink)
- All informal communication can be done via. Slack
- Any correspondence between the Capstone partner and the group should have Simon CC'd
- All decisions should be made collaboratively (should probably make this more specific)
