# Expectations Between Group Members and Simon

- Communicates regularly with us
- Guide us on the project in terms of Milestones, what needs to be completed by when, etc.

# Communication

- All meetings should be documented by somebody (notes) and uploaded to the [private Github repo](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/TransLink)
- All informal communication can be done via. Slack
- Any correspondence between the Capstone partner and the group should have Simon CC'd
- All decisions should be made collaboratively (should probably make this more specific). If anyone feels unfair or not comfortable by any group decision, please always say it and let others know. 
- Check slack regularly and clear your confusions on time.

# Group meetings
 - Meetings can be held on daily.Time for the meeting: 10:00 am(a head start for deliverables of the day)
 - Extra meeting hours can be discussed and agreed upon as required


# Completing tasks
  - Be transparent if you are unable to complete the task assigned
  - Prioritize the basics (get a working viable product, then work on optimization)
  - Voice your ideas/concerns and feedback promptly/frequently
  - Don't stress, this is supposed to be fun!
  - If you get stuck, ask a team mate for help instead of struggling on your own
  - In case  any unavoidable  circumstance or situation comes up, the person can inform the other team members, so that others can work on the deliverables


# Deadlines:
 - We can specify some datelines within our group, then we can review our works.
