# Proposal Structure

## Summary (Conclusion expected)

## Introduction

Background information, objective (help reduce the insurance cost), research question, and basic methodology (paraphrase the research question in an introductory way), and the final output ()


### Research question? Predictive and explanatory

-	What are the main predictors of frequency and severity of bus accidents?
-	Correlation between **** and accident rate?
-	What factors prevent the incidents of claims? 
### Data product:
-	Report 
-	Dashboard (EDA plots, predictive model) (Sketch of dashboard)


## Methodology (Data science techniques):
-	Data wrangling to have clean data ready for use
-	Use plotly to create a dashboard to display the correlation between various features and accident rate 
-	We can use supervised learning (linear regression/tree-based model) to identify the important features(predictors), (feature selection/engineering)





Notes: 
-	To find out if the data is balanced

Background introduction, and what translink wants and we developed the question based on their needs, and how can we plan to answer the question using what data science techniques.
