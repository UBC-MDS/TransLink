## Communications
- document everything, meetings, meeting notes
- cc Simon everytime with any correspondence with the Capstone partner

## Use of Slack

- report, presentation, data wrangling --- maybe separate Slack channels?
- meeting notes (Google drive, private Github repo, etc.)

## Capstone Partner

- clarify what they want
- clarify what the data looks like
- how do they expect us to work, do they care? is it important that we put it on Github?
- how do we communicate with them?
